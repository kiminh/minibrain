    " - Performance (errors, accuracy, other metrics)\n",
    " - Learning Speed (in cycles)\n",
    " - Compare results of BOTH types of networks at initialization moment with a final Linear decoder\n",
    " - Operation complexity (number of OPS for example for each to get to a meaningful representation)\n",
    " - Compare a  random set of Tuning Neuron Ensembles (TNEs) with a final linear decoder\n",
